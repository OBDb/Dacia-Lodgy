    description: "The Dacia Lodgy was a budget-friendly compact MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) that offered seven-seat practicality at an exceptionally competitive price point. Built on a modified version of the Dacia/Renault B0 platform, it featured a boxy, utilitarian design that prioritized interior space and functionality over style. Available in five or seven-seat configurations, it offered impressive passenger room and flexible seating arrangements. Engine options typically included 1.2L to 1.5L petrol units and a 1.5L dCi diesel, all focused on economy rather than performance. The interior was basic but functional, with later models offering improved technology including an available touchscreen infotainment system with navigation. Safety features were adequate but not class-leading, reflecting the vehicle's budget positioning. A Stepway variant added SUV-inspired styling elements including increased ride height, roof rails, and plastic body cladding. Despite its utilitarian approach, the Lodgy successfully filled a market gap for affordable family transportation, particularly in countries where price sensitivity was high. Production ended in 2022 without a direct replacement, as Dacia shifted focus to the Jogger, which combines MPV practicality with crossover styling elements."
